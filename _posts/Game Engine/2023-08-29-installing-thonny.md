# Installing Thonny

**To write MicroPython code for the retroPy, we recommend using Thonny.**

Thonny is free and available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Head over to [Thonny.org](https://thonny.org/) and select your preferred download type for your OS by hovering over the names.

For easy and quick setups, we recommend downloading and using the installers over pip installations.

Run the installers and follow the instructions. You now have Thonny installed!



> Should you not have admin privileges, a portable version for Windows is available, where you can download and extract the zip package and run Thonny.exe without needing to go through the installation process.
> Moving the whole folder and running it off a USB drive works too.
